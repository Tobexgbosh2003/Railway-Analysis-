# Railway-Analysis-
This repository contains mock train ticket data for National Rail services in the UK, spanning from January to April 2024. The dataset simulates a variety of train journeys, providing details such as ticket types, journey dates and times, departure and arrival stations, ticket prices, and other key attributes. It is designed for use in testing, data analysis, and simulation purposes related to the UK rail industry.
# Introduction 
This dataset has been analyzed using Power BI and presents an analysis of train tickets sold within a 4-month period (January to April 2024). The mock dataset simulates train ticket sales for journeys across the UK National Rail network.

The dataset includes tickets for various travel classes (Standard, First Class, and Off-Peak) and journeys between numerous departure and arrival stations. Tickets are categorized by type, journey date and time, train operators, and ticket status (e.g., Booked, Cancelled, Pending).

Tickets are either purchased directly or pre-booked online, reflecting two key sales channels. The analysis focuses on identifying trends in ticket sales, popular routes, and average ticket prices. It provides valuable insights for assessing ticket pricing strategies, passenger behavior, and service optimization.

This mock dataset is ideal for testing, visualizations, and simulations related to the UK's National Rail system.
# Problem Statement
The following questions are the recommended analysis
What are the most popular departure and arrival stations?

Which ticket types and classes generate the most revenue?

What are the main reasons for delays and cancellations?

Which days and times are the busiest for travel?

How does city-wise revenue and refund percentage vary?
